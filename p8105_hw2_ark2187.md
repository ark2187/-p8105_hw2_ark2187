## Problem 1

First I will read and clean the Mr.Â Trash Wheel sheet:

  - specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries
    (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using
    arguments in read\_excel
  - use reasonable variable names
  - omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
  - round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts
    the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

<!-- end list -->

``` r
trash_wheel = 
  read_excel("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = 1, skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  select(-x15, -x16, -x17) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...15
    ## * `` -> ...16
    ## * `` -> ...17

Next I will read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018. For
each omit rows without precipitation data and add a variable year. Next,
combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable
(the variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).

``` r
precip_17 = 
  read_excel("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = 6, skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  select(year, month, total)

precip_18 = 
  read_excel("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = 5, skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  select(year, month, total)

precip_all = 
  full_join(precip_17, precip_18) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month", "total")

My trash\_wheel data set has 344 observations, and my precip\_all data
set has 24 observations. Trash\_wheel includes variables to show the
number of items removed from the harbor, such as `glass_bottles` and
`grocery_bags`. We can also see that the median number of `sports_balls`
in the dumpster in 2017 was 8. The precip\_all dataframe can show us
that the total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.
